Cyber security Notes

Layer of the OS System Stack:
Hardware -> Firmware -> BIOS (Binary input/output systems) -> (Operating System starts here) Kernal -> Shell -> File System -> 		
Underlined = OS 

General notes about OS:
-	Inside of a computer is like a city
-	Hardware and firmware are the roads and buildings for the city (computer)
-	Binary = Machine Language.
-	BIOS and Firmware run on Assembly.
-	BIOS is the firmware for the motherboard.
-	BIOS takes attendance for the computer parts. That is the only job of the BIOS. It checks if everything is working properly.
-	When the BIOS is done its job, it hands the job to the Kernal. 
-	Kernal = Seed (metamorphically)
-	Firmware is the base layer of programming that exists on the hardware itself.
-	OS is like a building, the Kernal is the shape of that building. So, it does not matter what the Kernal looks like it will still get the job done.
-	Different OSs are better suited for different tasks. It is like narrow Hallways and wide Hallways.
-	Kernal is the translator/messenger. It serves as a bridge between the hardware and the software
-	Kernal sets up what you are going to do, makes the OS more ready for your activities
-	Kernal sets up that Architecture.
-	There are 2 types of OS GUY (Graphical User Interface) and Headless

Storage:
Hard Disk/HDD Hard disk drive:
Volatile memory is short term memory and fast to access.
Nonvolatile memory is long term memory and takes longer to get the data out.
-	Consists of rings
-	Rings of blocks
-	A binder is organized just like a Hard Disk
-	There are millions of blocks in a Hard Disk
-	We need to label data to know where they belong
-	At the beginning of a block a part is reserved for addressing (tell where the data is)
-	Another thing that is reserved in a block that tells us what is stored in this block, It tells which block to go after it is done from this block
-	Each block has 4kb of storage
-	Defragmenting will reorganize data to make it faster to read, store them close to each other
-	Check sum will store compressed data after the processor does the math
-	If the stored does not match the check sum, then the file will not open
-	Check sum is a security feature
-	 A check sum checks for Trogen viruses
-	Cells inside blocks are made of metal/cobalt 
-	Magnets can move Cobalt’s atoms
-	Read write head
-	We can change cobalt’s north and south poles without flipping the actual piece of metal
-	Electrons inside atoms flip when certain magnets change it
-	The read head will generate a wave which can be translated to Binary
-	If a file leaves a certain amount of space in a hard disk block, then that space is going to be wasted

Virtual Machine:
-	The main purpose of a virtual machine is to run different operating systems or software without needing separate physical computers for each one. For example, if you have a Windows computer but need to use a program that only works on a Mac, you can create a virtual machine that runs macOS inside your windows computer. This way, you can use that program without needing to buy a separate Mac.
-	A virtual machine is a thing that utilizes a computer hardware. 
-	It allows you to run multiple OS
-	OS controls hardware
-	VM likes to think it has its own computer components. 
-	When we setup our VMs we will choose the confines of our system
-	We can do whatever we want.
-	Host machine is the machine that hosts the VM.
-	If a VM is harmed it won’t affect the host computer
-	

What are permissions in a computer system:
-	A configuration is a grouping/ How you sort stuff is a configuration/ The way you describe it/
-	One of the most basic types of hacking is social. Hacking is not all about sitting behind a keyboard with flashing stuff on a screen.
-	We will setup configurations on our VM
-	An example of permissions and configuration is our school account.
-	Companies that are trusted sources have insurance, which can include digital insurance.

Terminal:
General notes about navigating the terminal:
•	Terminals are case sensitive.
•	If there is space in a file name, we must quote the name for it to work.
•	Linux terminals are case sensitive.
•	Windows uses back slash (\) Linux uses forward slash (/)
•	Everything between the cologne and dollar sign is current location.
•	/home/user/
•	Flag starts with (-) and then a letter is written after it. Example ls -l
•	Quotes are used for folders with more than one word.
•	Can’t make a folder with the same name as something else.
•	Script vs Program 
•	Open doesn’t equal run
Figure out how to:
•	Make a folder. Yes
o	mkdir (make directory) 
•	Make a file (txt) Yes
o	touch_nameStuff
•	Rename a folder. Yes	
•	Rename a file. Yes
•	Move a folder. Yes
•	Move a file (txt) Yes
o	mv_name
•	{command } –help or ?
•	Nano 
o	Save == write out
•	Change file types. Example: .txt to .odt
•	Go back 1 Directory
•	How to delete something 
Commands:
•	cd: change directory. Example: nasr@debian:~$ cd Documents
•	pwd: present working directory. Example: nasr@debian:~$ pwd
•	ls: gives you a list of all the folders you have access to. Example: nasr@debian:~$ ls
•	../: Go back up 1. Example: nasr@debian:~$ cd ..
•	../../: Chain ../ together
•	clear: clear
•	ctrl + z: Cancel whatever process you are working on and go back to terminal.
•	mkdir: Makes new folder inside specified directory. nasr@debian:~$ mkdir (Folder name)
•	touch: Makes new .txt file in specified directory. nasr@debian:~$ touch (File name)
•	mv: Renames specified file or folders. Example: nasr@debian:~/Documents$ mv (File or Folder name) (new name)
•	mv: Moves files and folders to specified locations (Note: /home/user/Documents). nasr@debian:~/Documents$ mv (File or Folder name) (new location)
•	cd / : Turns location into root directory and that should make the terminal location /
Bash Commands: 
•	
Unorganized notes That need to be organized:
•	ls -l gives us details 
•	Touch makes a file
•	 Op
•	.sh is for bash files
•	Files open depending on what file they are
•	Bash command runs a nano file
•	In nano variables are written with a “$” beforeclea
•	Nano and if terminal is very finicky (sensitive)
•	If statements use [] brackets
•	-lt means less than
•	Elif means else if
•	Fi ends else statement. 
•	Do ChatGPT assignment
